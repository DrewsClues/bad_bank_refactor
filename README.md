# bad_bank_refactor

## Description/Motivation
This project includes both the front and back end of a banking application.  The reason I am working on this project is to facilitate my learning of full stack development. 

## Installation
Download the files from the repository into a single directory. Open a terminal and run npm init, npm install cors, npm install mongodb, and npm install express. Then make sure you have docker installed on your computer. Run the command: docker run -p 27017:27017 --name badbank -d mongo   
One these steps have been completed running to command node index.js in the terminal should start the server and allow you access the application by navigating to localhost:3000 in the browser. 

## Technoloy
This project uses HTML, CSS and ReactJs for the front end, MongoDB, Cors, and Express for the backend. 

## Features
This application allows one to create accounts in a fake bank, then withdraw and or deposit funds from said accound and have those values updated across the application.
In the future I would like to add authentication to the application using firebase.
